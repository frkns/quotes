<h3>&emsp;&emsp;Life Advice From GPT-2</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Go outside. My fellow nerds often refer to urban wilderness as a "good smell", and it sure beats the public air that passes for America's first city. It's not a bad idea to get out of the city and into a nearby park or a city's reserve, to get some fresh air and occasionally have a look around. All cities have trees and a good part of them are almost entirely free to look at. You can get them for free.</li>
    <li>Keep calm and break the negativity. "When we get out of our own way, when we create a positive environment, positive people create positive results." </li>
    <li>Recharge. "Avoid the temptation to check messages, to respond instantaneously, to react on demand. Retain your natural judgment."</li>
    <li>Soothe. "Always start with a statement of sympathy and understanding, and develop from there."</li>
    <li>Connect. "Give people a chance to tell you a funny or interesting story, but never give up. Be willing to let people finish their stories; you can pick up a story you missed later."</li>
    <li>"On public transportation, be my friend." You cannot avoid bumping into people. One of my goals is to remove this feeling. If you are on a bus and your friend is right there next to you, kiss the back of his neck, say hi to him, "you're so pretty" (if you're both women) or "you are like a goddess!"</li>
    <li>Use a good hammer, use a good wrench, use a fine carpenter's hammer, because then you will be able to use a good iron, that can run over a million cycles, which is a lot for us kids, so we don't have to use a good hammer, because we have this funny looking paper airplane.</li>
    <li>Learning a new language is easy. This is true, but people often forget how hard it is to become fluent in any language. We learn languages through passive listening and reading. All of the grammar is a code you have to learn for your brain to digest the language. And it is a lot harder to go from an advanced level reader to someone who can speak your native language. But it is not impossible to learn fluent skills. And people can, but the distance to get there is huge. (No one learns Spanish in a week, do they?)</li>
    <li>Teach your children to be independent. No. Your kids don't need that! Let's make this very clear: kids are not meant to be spoiled and taken care of by you. Your kid will learn that independence comes with a price.</li>
    <li>Teach them that you are watching them. I'm afraid I don't have the physical stamina for this, but it is necessary. If your children don't do things for themselves, the parent and even you will be watching them. It's a helluva lot easier when you're here watching than it is to watch.</li>
    <li>Scour your memories â€“ This is the most basic bit and I always think of it as the easiest way to treat anxiety. You need to look at all the memories you've had over the past couple of years that involve anxiety. Think about the anxiety you had and the emotions you experienced as well as thoughts that you had. If you think you've already looked at all these things, then you can go about looking for yourself.</li>
    <li>You can turn to friends for help in times of stress. One of the greatest traits that makes an athlete better than any other person is the ability to rely on others. Why? Because that is how the human mind evolved. A huge part of the problem is that I have to rely on my wife and children more so than I ever have in the past. I hope this blog post can be a source of strength for you.</li>
    <li>If you're unhappy with your partner, let him or her know right away. Yes, you have to agree to everything, but you can't say you're unhappy and deny it, and if he's not listening to what you're saying, you're not doing your relationship any good.</li>
    <li>And to all the other hypocrites, do not do the works of the flesh; for it is impossible for you to do the works of the flesh to the glory of God. For you cannot do the things of the flesh, to gratify the desires of men. For you can do only what you have seen God doing: for even your very selves, if you are not partakers of the divine nature, are passions and wrath, and a crooked and damaged conscience, and lack wisdom. (Rom. 8:7-9)</li>
    <li>Don't be afraid to ask questions and not assume you know the answer. The fact is, you need to be willing to go the extra mile. Finding an answer to a question does not automatically mean you know the answer. In order to understand and achieve true innovation, you must ask yourself a question every now and then, and come up with your own answer. Only by doing so can you truly innovate and push the envelope of progress.</li>
    <li>You won't be making any money for a while, so you don't need all the guarantees. My best advice is to invest in something that has no guaranteed profits in the first year or so of operation. That way you won't be tempted to run away with the money.</li>
    <li>Your customers expect you to do well and you're most likely wrong so focus on improving. You need to have a reasonable amount of insurance in place before any of this stuff will actually happen.</li>
    <li>Never even begin to go in the direction of withdrawing. For the things I can control, the more work I put in, the better. Just moving a little to the right or to the left of my subject will make a bigger difference in the end.</li>
    <li>Don't play too soon. Make sure that, if at all possible, the player stays away from rankings until they have reached a certain level of self-assessment and are in a position to judge themselves for improvement. You might find that as a beginner, you've been playing two weeks at a time when you've really needed a few weeks of refocusing before moving on. Your habits have been rock solid for so long that you might be blind to how long it will take to start learning new habits.</li>
    <li>Keep it up. That is always the secret. If you don't keep it up, you'll never get anywhere. Be innovative, do something unique, and constantly be progressing, every minute of the day. When you are in the big leagues, everyone will be, but when you have to hit and keep the ball, then you need to stay at the top.</li>
    <li>Work until you can't work anymore.Working the long hours of reality TV is even more exhausting than hours at work. The days start off fast and may seem like there's not a lot to do, but quickly it all becomes overwhelming as the competition grows and you finally run out of ideas, contestants get killed off, and you have to compete against those other kids to prove that you still have a burning desire to run everything.</li>
    <li>So what do you do? One answer is to simply work for a set amount of time to clear your head. Get your mind off of the game and start solving problems that you can't think of today.</li>
    <li>Take an informed position when you can (you have the right to be different, be different, or to be absolutely right): That's a great way to think of yourself.</li>
    <li>Vague statements based on emotion are a form of gaslighting . And you may well end up being blamed for it. It's hard to admit that you may be wrong about a certain matter because of the emotions that you have.</li>
    <li>Advertising on the internet will lose your business. There's a lot of wisdom in this one. Just make sure to emphasize that your ad is not legitimate, because if you're lucky, you can get a ton of traffic without your website (I know a couple businesses that have used this strategy). If you decide to advertise on Google or some other search engine, be aware that the best time to do so will be near the beginning of the search results (usually around the 50th position).</li>
    <li>Don't stress about being too far from clients (or somewhere good to be). Some agents go to the client's house to scout potential clients and service them at home. They meet the kids, go over the tools. This is very important and you should at least try this once. If it doesn't work you can always go to the beach or dinner with your girlfriends. I don't mind taking clients out for lunch/dinner (and the pool is the highlight of the week for me) but I'm quite happy to be in the city.</li>
